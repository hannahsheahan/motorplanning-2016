# 2016-MotorPlanning
This repository contains some ugly, really old analysis scripts for data published in:  Sheahan, Franklin &amp; Wolpert (2016). Motor planning, not execution, separates motor memories. Neuron 92:4, p773-779.

This should have been made to execute much much faster by pre-analysing and saving the reduced, analysed datasets, but I haven't bothered - these scripts are just for record-keeping and reproducability.
