# 2016-MotorPlanning
This repository contains analysis scripts for data published in:  Sheahan, Franklin &amp; Wolpert (2016). Motor planning, not execution, separates motor memories. Neuron 92:4, p773-779.

This could be made to execute much faster by pre-analysing and saving the reduced, analysed datasets as in repo: imaginemotorfuture2018, but I haven't bothered to add that since these scripts are just for record and reproducability.
